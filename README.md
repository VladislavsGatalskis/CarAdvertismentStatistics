# CarAdvertismentStatistics

Application that scrapes data using Scrapy framework from SS.COM for creating some statistics about car adverts. To scrape the data you have to run the run.py script (/advertscrape/some_py_scripts/run.py). After it's done run diagramCreator.py script (/advertscrape/some_py_scripts/diagramCreator.py) and it will open 4 diagrams in your browser (the diagramCreator.py script is hardcoded to create the diagrams from the data that was scraped on 2020-05-28; you can change that).
